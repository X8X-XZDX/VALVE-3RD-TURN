# Until Further Notice

Too many moderator actions have been taken on platforms this github has been posted to for the project to be able to stand by itself.  Without community support, or without social support, I really do not know what to do other than finish the steam proposal file and hope for the best.

No one will get back to me, the steam forums just had a partial cover up overnight, I'm one of like 3 people who noticed, or even bothered to care that anything happened, and even more tp the point, without any actual consistant basis other than "Valve is ripping us off" no one will listen to me anyways.

So, at this point, until something major happens, or until someone actually wants to help, the files are bundled, and this GHub is shut down.

Should anyone want to take up the work, unpack the bundle and send me a link.

# Valve's 3rd Turn

### A Proposal to Reintegrate Community and Mods into Valve's Core Structure, with Monetary Value Increased for Both User and Company Alike.

\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\\

| Short Summary |

Reintegrating the Community via Steam back into the core structure of Valve would not only enable them to have an almost inane stream of ideas moving at all times to pick from, they would be able to build Sales around Steam and the Steam Deck, should Community Interaction become the Forefront of the platform.  This would involve a large focus on the Steam Deck, Platform Interaction, Modding, and integrating a better modding platform for end users, such as Gitlab, and a "Steam Modhub" client, similar to a Github Desktop Client.  Though, instead of just having a "push" button, on top of this new mod structure, there should be a fast, Twitter-Like social media platform for interaction.  Mastodon, for example.

For a short time, access to this new structure can be limited to Steam Deck only, maybe 1 to 2 years, in order to pump money into the next development cycle of the Steam Deck, and support new development.  This can be made reliable with a low cost Steam Deck made available for sale that only drops in price with newer hardware iterations.


| Thesis |


There are a few elements when thinking about the future of Valve.


1.  Business Decisions

2.  Market Dominance

3.  Hardware and Software Developement

4.  Their effect on the rest of the market

5.  The Market's Effect on Them

6.  Keeping Pace with Competitors Design / Setting a New Pace


In the beginning, Valve became knows for their form of operation.  Today we would recognize this as basically github, but back in the days of SVN and passing CD's around offices, this was unheard of.

Not only did every employee have the ability to collaborate with each other, everyone working on something in a major group had their collaboration happen IN PERSON, rather than across an email chain spread throughout the office.  Supposedly this is how it still works; however, due to some reports from contractors, and developers who decided to quit, there was an in-office element in recent years of employees not being "Real Valve", and therefore recieving demoted duties.

This is vastly different to the Valve that most are familiar with, and has been largely ignored by the masses, it seems, despite reports coming out thru sources like VNN and others that Valve have a trusting relationship with.

Despite these issues, Valve maintains a market dominance unlike any other.  And for good reason.  Their percentages in sales are standard to the letter of the law, 30\70 split plus a posting fee.  This is much better than some of their competitors, or even trying to run a site yourself to sell a game and running an ad campaign.  All of your advertising is integrated, and they even allow you a certain number of keys to sell off platform, assuming that new users will be coming TO the platform with those keys.  The only agreement is that you must match your steam price.

This is why you often see humble bundle packs have Non-AAA games sold, these developers are allowed to sell these keys per Steam's TOS.

First party developers often have a hardware platform, a store to sell the software on the hardware, and many permutations from then on.  The advantage that Steam has over those First Party Hosts, however, is spreading outside of just a proprietary market, but to every PC that it could be installed to.

We all know this, this is why they have a solid dominance over platforms like Desura, GOG, and even Epic Games.

With this comes an added bonus that they have started designing their own hardware at Valve with the Steam Deck, the Valve Index, and even having a hand in helping with the HTC Vive.  This largely increases their Brand, and Notoriety with the community.  On top of availability of Schematics to repair Hardware were it to break, they make parts available to purchase on their platform.  This is a sign of good business.

Some hardware manufacturers have decided to even make compatible devices that can attach via Steam Link.  The higher availability of hardware similar to the Steam Deck means that Valve still has a Large Grip on the market.

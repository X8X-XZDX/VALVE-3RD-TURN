+++++++

There are a few elements when thinking about the future of Valve.

1 Hardware Development
    1a. Developing with the Steam Deck
    1b. Hardware Changes for VR
        1ba. VR+Deck for Portable Office

2 Software Compatibility
3 The Portability of Both in Combo
4 Making ALL Elements User Servicable / Moddable
5 Bringing Steam into a New Social Landscape

Following that, it is KEY for Valve to be careful in its funding with future hardware updates, hardware changes making supply reups take time, and the ability to restock outlier areas for distribution of that hardware.
